If you want to know more about the cast and plot of Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, here are some facts you might find interesting:

- **Cast:** The movie features an ensemble cast of talented actors, some of whom are new to the franchise and some of whom are returning from previous films. Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt, the leader of the IMF team and a master of disguise and combat. Jeremy Renner plays William Brandt, a former IMF agent who joins Hunt's team as an analyst. Simon Pegg plays Benji Dunn, a tech expert and comic relief who was promoted to field agent after Mission: Impossible III. Paula Patton plays Jane Carter, a seductive and skilled agent who seeks revenge for the death of her partner. Michael Nyqvist plays Kurt Hendricks, aka Cobalt, the main antagonist who is a rogue nuclear strategist with a nihilistic agenda. Vladimir Mashkov plays Anatoly Sidorov, a Russian intelligence officer who pursues Hunt's team after the Kremlin bombing. Samuli Edelmann plays Marius Wistrom, Hendricks' right-hand man and a weapons dealer. Anil Kapoor plays Brij Nath, an Indian media tycoon and a potential buyer of the nuclear codes. LÃ©a Seydoux plays Sabine Moreau, a French assassin who kills Hunt's colleague and steals the codes. Josh Holloway plays Trevor Hanaway, an IMF agent who is killed by Moreau in the opening scene.
- **Plot:** The movie follows Hunt and his team as they try to stop Hendricks from launching a nuclear war between the United States and Russia. After escaping from a Moscow prison with the help of Dunn, Hunt receives a mission to infiltrate the Kremlin and retrieve files on Cobalt, but the mission goes wrong when someone detonates a bomb that destroys part of the building. Hunt's team is blamed for the attack and the IMF is disavowed by the U.S. president, who initiates \"Ghost Protocol\", meaning that Hunt and his team have no support or backup. Hunt manages to escape from Sidorov and meets with IMF Secretary (Tom Wilkinson), who gives him a new mission: to find Hendricks and stop him from using the nuclear codes he bought from Moreau. The Secretary is killed by Russian agents, but not before assigning Brandt to join Hunt's team. Hunt learns that Hendricks plans to use a Russian satellite to launch a nuclear missile at San Francisco, which would trigger a counterattack from the U.S. and start a global war that Hendricks believes would benefit humanity. Hunt and his team travel to Dubai, where they intercept Moreau and Wistrom during a meeting with Nath at the Burj Khalifa tower. In a daring stunt, Hunt climbs the outside of the tower using magnetic gloves and hacks into Wistrom's phone to get the codes. However, he realizes too late that Wistrom is actually Hendricks in disguise, and that he has given him the real codes instead of fake ones. Hendricks escapes with the codes, while Moreau is killed by Carter in a fight.
